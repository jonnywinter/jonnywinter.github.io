*"The Cisco Umbrella Enforcement API is designed to give technology partners the ability to send security events from their platform/service/appliance within a mutual customerâ€™s environment to the Umbrella cloud for enforcement. You may also list the domains and delete individual domains from the list. All received events will be segmented by the mutual customer and used for future enforcement."* - [Enforcement API on docs.umbrella.com](https://docs.umbrella.com/enforcement-api/docs)

## Summary

After stumbling onto Salnikov Andrey's [article](https://medium.com/@salnikov.andrei/hey-google-enable-my-meraki-guest-wifi-cc49bc01bc73) on Medium, I got inspired to do something similar but with a twist. I wanted to use Google Assistant & APIs, but I wanted to use the [Cisco Umbrella](https://umbrella.cisco.com/) [Enforcement API](https://docs.umbrella.com/enforcement-api/docs) to block a site on command rather than Meraki, use [Azure App Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/services/app-service/) instead of [PythonAnywhere](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/) and feed a variable between [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/) & [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/) as opposed to a static webhook endpoint. In this post I'm going to detail the steps required to simulate the below video in your own environment whilst adding in contextual information where relevant -

## Let's Begin

**&lt;NOTE>**: Instead of re-inventing the wheel and explaining things that have been well defined by someone else, I have included links next to some words/technologies/acronyms/protocols that I feel could proove useful to those not yet 'in the know'. **&lt;/NOTE>**

WORDS

Happy scripting!
