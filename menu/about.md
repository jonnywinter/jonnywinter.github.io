### About this blog

Fuelled by tech-knowledge and caffeine, I’ve decided it’s high time to make a blog. This site and its contents will be formed of projects, tools, tips, tricks, guides & fixes that I’m either working on, have just finished or have been squireling away for far too long. So, fellow tech-heads – fill your boots, share & feel free to reach out and contact me.
